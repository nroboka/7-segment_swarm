# 7-segment display with individual robots

## The goal of the project
7-segment displays have been in mainstream use for decades, and recorded use of the technology even dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. The goal of our project is to implement a ROS workspace which can manage to spawn seven mobile robots in a simulated world, and these robots can cooperate to work as the seven segments of the display to get a desired number's representation.
